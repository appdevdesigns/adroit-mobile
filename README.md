The Adroit app has been developed primarily for The Family Connection Foundation (www.fcfthailand.org). It allows volunteers to upload photos into the FCF Adroit System, add captions, locations, photo dates, and  tag volunteers in the photo. These photos are then used by FCF Administrative Staff to produce reports to be submitted to Thai Government Agencies on behalf of volunteers.
