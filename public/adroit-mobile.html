    <h1 id="top">Welcome to<br/>Adroit Mobile!</h1>
    <p>
      We are very excited to have the Adroit Mobile app available for our volunteers to use to capture all the exciting
      ministry they are doing throughout Thailand. Although the app is very user-friendly, we do want to provide you
      with some brief information on using Adroit Mobile. These help pages will be divided into the following sections:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="#interface-overview">Interface Overview</a>
      </li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>With that said, let’s get to it!</p>
    <h2 id="interface-overview">Interface Overview</h2>
    <p>
      When you log in for the first time, you will be presented with the “Getting started with Adroit” tutorial screen
      shown below. Everyone is encouraged to walk through this tutorial to get a basic overview of the various parts of
      the Adroit App.
    </p>

      If you ever want to go back and review the tutorial again, you can do so by clicking on the “hamburger” menu in
      the upper left and selecting “Show Tutorial”.

        <div>Status Bar</div>

      <p>
        This status bar provides you with details regarding the number of photos you have uploaded in relation to the
        reporting period.
      </p>
      <img src="img/status_bar.png" class="fullwidth" />
      <p>The status bar shows...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many of your uploaded photos have been approved</li>
        <li> How many of your uploaded photos are new (and yet to be approved)</li>
        <li>How many days are left in the current reporting period</li>
        <li>
          A quick visual on how you are doing:
          <div class="status-container">
            <div class="status-image">
              <img src="img/status_ahead.png" />

            <div class="status-image">

            </div>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          The bar graph (on the bottom) compares how far through the current reporting period we are (black vertical
          bar) with how many approved photos you have uploaded (green progress bar) and how many new photos you have
          uploaded (black progress bar). A good goal is to keep the green progress bar ahead of the black vertical bar.
